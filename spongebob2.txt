Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.
Patrick: How is Gary?
SpongeBob: He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.
Patrick: Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you... something important. Oh, I remember. Uh... [SpongeBob is gone] Who was I talking to?
SpongeBob: [puts the bag of snail food down and notices a piece of paper on the door] Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. "Dear Sir or Ma'am... [goes inside] We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience." [doorbell rings] Hello? [gasps] My package. Whoopee! [takes it inside while leaving the bag of snail food outside] Oh, let's see what we got here. [cuts it open] My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah! [grunts] What's this? "Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row." Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge. [takes the ball and hits it on the paddle, but it comes back and hits him in the eye] Darn it. [Tries again; results are the same] Darn it. [this happens again] Darn it.
Gary: [goes into the kitchen and sees that his food bowl is empty. He checks the time and it is snack time] Meow.
SpongeBob: [paddleball hits him in the eye again] Darn it.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What was that?
Gary: [louder] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. [when he tries the paddleball again, Gary interrupts]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble. [when he lifts his paddleball up, Gary is attached to it]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion. [Dirty Bubble on the box laughs] Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it. [Gary slithers off] Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying. [Gary jumps on SpongeBob's face, making him run around and scream] Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get! [throws him away and grunts] And leave your master to his important affairs. [Gary rolls into his bowl and sees a crumb of food left. A bunch of spiders crawl out of it. Gary packs his things] Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.
Gary: Meow. [Gary slithers off away, down a river, and takes a bus out of town. Cut to next day. Patrick then exits his rock with cup of coffee]
Patrick: [drinks his coffee, then eats the cup and walks towards SpongeBob's house] I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him. [knocks on the door, then notices the bag of snail food on the ground, much to his surprise] That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand. [walks in] Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Oh, darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob? [opens the door to the galley to SpongeBob lying on the ground]
SpongeBob: Darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, what happened? [runs over to a picture of a Krabby Patty on the wall] This picture is crooked. [puts the picture back to his original place] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [looks at the paddle; with bloodshot eyes] Darn it.
Patrick: Snap out of it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I...
Patrick: What is it, buddy? You can tell me.
SpongeBob: I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.
Patrick: You what?! [cries]
SpongeBob: Why are you crying, Patrick?
Patrick: Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: What happened?
Patrick: I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.
SpongeBob: You lost the...? That's terrible! [comforts his despondent friend] Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk.
Patrick: Thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important? [trips over Gary's bowl] Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary. [gets the bag of snail food outside] That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours. [brings it in and pours it in Gary's bowl] Gary! Dinner! [takes out a triangle] Come on, Gary, soup's on. [rings it] Gary? Hey, Pat?
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: [twitches his eye two times; obviously worried and stressed] How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?
Patrick: About a week.
SpongeBob: [shocked] A week? Are you sure?
Patrick: Hmmm... well... [pours the glass of milk upside down. The milk is revealed to be solid, which falls like jelly. Sniffs the jelly. Starts eating the solid milk, analyzing the taste closely. Makes a sour face after tasting the overly sour taste.] Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.
SpongeBob: [horrified] Ten days? Gary! [searches all over the house for Gary, but he can't find him] Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! [in the kitchen, Patrick is sleeping, until SpongeBob pops out, startling Patrick] Patrick!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: [his eyes fill up with tears as his lip quivers] I can't find Gary.
Gary: [is slithering across the sand. Echoing howls are heard. Gary looks at his stomach and it's howling at him. Gary sneezes] Meow.
SpongeBob: This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.
Patrick: Eight?
SpongeBob: Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it. [Patrick shakes it, but it makes no noise] Let me see that. [SpongeBob tries it, but it still makes no noise] Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new... [Patrick belches. SpongeBob shakes his belly and Patrick laughs]
Patrick: I only tasted six types of sediment. [cut to nighttime where SpongeBob and Patrick are searching for Gary. Patrick is shaking his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here? [lifts a flower up] Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh. [jiggles his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself? [SpongeBob and Patrick open Squidward's door while he is in the bathtub] [screams three times and pants]
SpongeBob: You check over there. I'll check in here. [checks in the bathtub Squidward is in] Find him yet, Pat?
Patrick: [pulls the sink out from the wall, making water shoot out everywhere] No, but I'll keep looking.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] But there's nowhere left to look.
Patrick: There's one place we haven't checked. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in front of the former's mailbox full of letters]
SpongeBob: I doubt Gary could fit in there.
Patrick: Can't hurt to look.
SpongeBob: Here goes nothing. [opens the mailbox and a bunch of letters shoot out and a rolled up paper falls on the ground] Look, Pat!
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: Let's see. "Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me." [he and Patrick are horrified] Dear Neptune, what have I done?
Patrick: [scornfully] What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.
SpongeBob: [sadly] Gary. [cut to Gary slithering into another town. A couple walks by him laughing, then sees Fred and Debbie Rechid eating inside a diner]
Fred: Are my pants too tight, dear? [takes a bite out of his burger, then notices Gary outside and closes the blinds on the window as they both laugh. Gary slithers along more until he stops and sees some nachos in an alleyway. When he is about to take a bite of it, three snails frighten him by hissing]
Snail #1: Look who came to dinner. [Gary runs away fearfully]
Snail #3: Guess he didn't like nachos. [Gary slithers away until he runs into a dark figure]
Gramma: There you are. [grabs Gary] There you are, Miss Tuffsy. Oh, gramma finally found you. She was starting to get worried. Now let's get to your home, Miss Tuffsy, and get you something to eat. Hmmm. [shakes Gary] You feel much lighter than Gramma remembers. [cut to Gramma's house where she is feeding Gary heart-shaped cookies and putting an electric blanket over him] There you go, Miss Tuffsy. Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.
Gary: Mmm.
Gramma: Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again. [Gary looks at a spoon collection and looks at a picture of snails] There you go. [puts some more cookies on] After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised. [drops empty cookie sheet] Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system. [music warbling faster as Gramma cranks the record player. Gary continues to eat cookies as jazz music begins to play] Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter. [dances] You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie. [while doing the dance, she breaks her back] Oh. [set Gary back on the chair] Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.
SpongeBob: Gary! Gary? Gary! [looks into a hat store. On the reflection of the window, a truck with a picture of a snail drives by and stops. SpongeBob turns around excitedly] Gary! [truck's logo says "Hungry Snails Loves Snail-Po". SpongeBob frowns Tires squeal as the dust gets into SpongeBob's face and makes him cough] Gary...! [crying in despair] Oh... Gary! [fade out to Gramma and Gary sitting on the couch watching TV]
Gramma: Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time. [clock reads 7:30] It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy. [when Gary jumps off the couch, a picture of SpongeBob comes out of his bag]
Gary: [sadly] Meow.
Picture of SpongeBob: [furiously] Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy? [Gary gives a raspberry. Gary goes into a bright and decorated room with Gramma]
Gramma: Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.
Gary: [questioningly] Meow?
Gramma: Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh, [Gary's sad, precious round eyes sparkle up at Gramma] I almost forgot your good night kiss. [kisses Gary] Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy. [walks out of the room and claps twice to make the lights go out. Cut to next day at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is walking into the Krusty Krab on his knees. He has bloodshot eyes]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...
Mr. Krabs: [snaps fingers] Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on. [puts his hat on his head] Knew I'd figure it out.
SpongeBob: [his tears drop on the patty] Gary.
Evelyn: Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Refund?! What's wrong with it?
Evelyn: Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears! [reveals that there are six tears on the patty]
Mr. Krabs: What the...?
SpongeBob: Gary... [crying]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!
SpongeBob: This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.
SpongeBob: Well, you see...
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob's mouth] That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy!
SpongeBob: If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.
Mr. Krabs: Wh...?
[cut to Patrick sleeping on the ground. A bunch of things fall on Patrick and wake him up]
Patrick: It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.
Patrick: But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do. [cut to Gramma]
Gramma: [squeezing orange juice from the orange] There you go, Miss Tuffsy—fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: How about a little more syrup on those pancakes? [pours syrup on the pancakes. Then takes the spoon and scoops up a bite for Gary] Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo! [cut to Gramma and Gary in the car] Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy. [engine revving, tires squeal as Gramma drives fast over to Martha's Craft Zone] Oh, here we are. [both walk inside. As soon as the door closes, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive in the front door with posters and tape]
SpongeBob: Here's a good spot. [puts a poster on the door] "Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob". Quick, hand me the tape.
Patrick: Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is no time for that. [Patrick goes in. SpongeBob sighs]
Patrick: Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.
Gramma: These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.
Patrick: Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!
Gramma: Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.
Patrick: Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary. [walks out as Gary stares at him]
SpongeBob: [finishes putting up the posters] There.
Patrick: [When Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half] Um...uhh...
SpongeBob: Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out. [walk off]
Gramma: [walks out] Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.
♪Gary, now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary. Gary, come home. Gary, can't you see I was blind, I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet, you're my best friend, too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word poem: Gary, come home!♪
Patrick: I want peanuts. [presses button in the airplane]
SpongeBob: Pat, no! [airplane loses control. Both scream as the airplane rides through the message in the sky "GARY COME HOME" and changes it to "LISA, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"]
Mable: Who is this 'Lisa' person?
Lenny: What? [Mable slaps him angrily. Cut to Gramma walking into her house]
Gramma: Gramma will get a lovely meat loaf in the oven for you.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Don't worry, it's no trouble at all. Easy to do. [Gary smells his newspaper pile]
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy. [Gary reads all the fliers that SpongeBob and Patrick made. Gary imagines SpongeBob in a thought bubble]
SpongeBob: Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go! [Gramma whistles]
Gramma: You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done. [Gary groans, then slithers over and opens a closet door to find a bunch of empty snail shells. Gary becomes horrified, he realizes that these are all the deceased snails that were overfed by Grandma, and Gary too] Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies. [belt on Gary's belly snaps. A bunch of fat breaks through his shell. The snails in the painting on the wall talk]
Snails in picture: Run! [Gary strains to get out of the shell pile, but does and rolls toward Gramma's cookie plate and out the pet door. She tries to throw cookies at him, but they get stuck in the door]
Gramma: You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too. [Gary looks behind him and Gramma is slowly walking behind him] Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love. [Gary hides behind some trashcans in the alleyway] Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.
Snail #3: Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.
Gramma: Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling. [Gary pushes Snail #3 out into the sidewalk]
Snail #3: Hey!
Gramma: Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.
Snail #3: Who?
Gramma: You must be starving. [Gary sighs deeply. Cut to SpongeBob trying to cry on his couch]
Patrick: Just let it out, buddy. That's right.
SpongeBob: [despondent] I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.
Patrick: Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood! [SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] They were awesome!
SpongeBob: Gary loved balsa wood! [runs off crying] I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind. [look at the giant sign of Gary] I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.
Gary: [climbs on SpongeBob's head] Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, like that. [Gary purrs] Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary! [He kisses Gary] So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.
Gary: [groans] Meow.
Mr. Gunther Fitz: Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know, your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusually large amount of failings from this classroom.
Mrs. Puff: That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.
Mr. Fitz: Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times. [Shows folder with a bunch of files. While flipping through them, Spongebob's picture is him laughing frame by frame while his laughter is heard]
Mrs. Puff: You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.
Mr. Fitz: We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.
SpongeBob: Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?
Mr. Fitz: Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.
Mrs. Puff: [in the boat with SpongeBob and Mr. Fitz] Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Seat-belt-aroony. One second. [gets tangled in seat-belt then squeezes self through. Mr. Fitz writes on his notepad]
Mrs. Puff: Then what do you do?
SpongeBob: Start the engine?
Mrs. Puff: Yes.
SpongeBob: [starts the boat] What do I do now?
Mrs. Puff: Drive the boat. [SpongeBob drives into a boat]
SpongeBob: Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you failed.
SpongeBob: I failed?
Mr. Fitz: It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties.
Mrs. Puff: I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore? [starts laughing louder and louder] No more... SpongeBob?! I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. [flies away] Free at last! Free at last!
SpongeBob: [in classroom] I got Mrs. Puff fired. [banging and crashing]
Sergeant Sam Roderick: Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor. [he smashes Mrs. Puff's nameplate] No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.
Nat: Does that mean... [Roderick throws Nat through the door]
Roderick: Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon? [All the students keep silent]
Monroe: Uhh, I'll eat one. [all gasp. Monroe walks to Roderick]
Roderick: Pick your favorite. [Monroe takes one and eats it] How's it taste?
Monroe: It's a delightful taste sensation.
Roderick: No eating in my classroom! [throws Monroe through another door] Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class... [everyone but SpongeBob run out] Looks like you're the man, Sponge.
SpongeBob: I am?
Roderick: [outside] Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive. [jumps in the boat]
Roderick: What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: Ready for my test, sir.
Roderick: [takes SpongeBob out of the boat] You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first. [shows roads will all sorts of obstacles] This is [the] most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.
SpongeBob: Crawl?
Roderick: Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. [SpongeBob crawls forward]
SpongeBob: Left turn. [turns left] Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!
Roderick: Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.
SpongeBob: Pebble! [crawls faster and more out of control. Gets the pebble stuck in his hand and goes on screaming] Oh whoa! [SpongeBob's butt gets set on fire rolls down the obstacle course then into the air, out of the water, then back down where the instructor catches him as he screams] Oh whoa! [he stops screaming] Whew! [falls with only his arm taken off]
Roderick: I'm ashamed of you, cadet. [removes the pebble from SpongeBob's hand] Tripped up by a wee pebble. [crushes the pebble] What are you suppose to be learning in my class?
SpongeBob: How to drive, sir?
Roderick: Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. And then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl. [bends SpongeBob's arm] I want you to crawl! [puts SpongeBob's arm back]
SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!
Roderick: Now get out there! [SpongeBob crawls around a hole then his instructor takes off his shoes and socks except the ripped top parts of his socks; he wiggles his toes after his shoes are forcibly taken off, and carries the instructor on his back barefooted. Then he stops at a stop sign, and runs in and out of some radioactive waste] Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out. [hands SpongeBob a wrench] Here, go take that boat apart. [SpongeBob takes the boat apart] I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again!
SpongeBob: [laughs] That'll be easy.
Roderick: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh... [laughs] I might need a couple minutes. [later, the instructor is sleeping] It's ready, sarge! [SpongeBob has re-assembled the boat into a rocket ship.]
Roderick: Jumpin' jellyfish... [the rocket blasts off]
SpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians! [crashes through a lot of pedestrians] So, umm, how'd I do?
Roderick: How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... [yelling] how you did!
SpongeBob: Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?
Roderick: Not quite. [puts blindfold on SpongeBob] Now do it blindfolded.
[SpongeBob crashes through another pedestrian off-screen.]
French Narrator: Several days later...
SpongeBob: 1003, 1004, 1005. [stops] Ooh, pebble #143. [steps over pebble] Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008. [old lady pedestrian pops up] Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13.
Roderick: Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel.
SpongeBob: Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm... [runs into a pole]
Roderick: [now in boat] Let's see what I taught you, laddy.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [drives boat] Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball. [SpongeBob continues] Nice boy.
Roderick: Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead. [SpongeBob parallel parks] Very good. [now at real exam] Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts. [puts on seatbelt with no problem]
Roderick: Excellent work, cadet. What's next?
SpongeBob: Step 2 would be... ignite engine.
Roderick: Step 3?
SpongeBob: Step 3 would be... [takes out blindfold and his eyes shrink] ...engage blindfold.
Roderick: What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.
SpongeBob: But I can't do it without a blindfold.
Roderick: Drive, boy! Drive!
[SpongeBob kicks down on the gas pedal and the boat is off. At the first turn is a giant red canister labeled "GAS." SpongeBob fails to make the right turn and instead crashes right into the gas can, obliterating the boating school faculty in a mushroom-radius explosion, and sending debris from the boating school sign, etc., flying everywhere. As the debris begins to clear, the boat flies into the air and goes soaring.]
Roderick: Mayday! Mayday! You're off course. [boat drives into 2 buildings then underground. Spurts out from a fire hydrant. Then crashes through a bakery and into a field where Mrs. Puff is painting the scenery]
Mrs. Puff: Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff notices the boat and attempts to paint something really quick. When boat runs into her, the painting shows SpongeBob, the instructor, and Mr. Fitz fearing their lives]
Roderick: The brake son!
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir. [takes brake apart] There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts.
Roderick: I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her. [jumps in front of the boat in an attempt to stop it] Come get some! [boat runs over him]
SpongeBob: Man down. Man down. [SpongeBob drives into the city and into each building] Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now. [boat drives out of the now destroyed city, and then cuts to SpongeBob driving while wearing Patrick's pants over his eyes] I can't see! I can't see!
Patrick: My pants!
SpongeBob: Hey, I can't see! [dodges traffic and pedestrians as Mrs. Puff screams. Parallel parks] Did I pass?
Mr. Fitz: Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have.
Patrick: [takes pants off SpongeBob's head] The nerve of some people.
Mr. Fitz: Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.
SpongeBob: [at boating school] Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm "unteachable".
Mrs. Puff: It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back. [sniffles, holds up a burnt, charred object] And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion, [voice breaking] so it's as if you never failed.
SpongeBob: I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff. [shows name tag] I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.
[Mrs. Puff puts her head down on her desk and begins to sob quietly, and the name tag shatters as the episode ends.]
