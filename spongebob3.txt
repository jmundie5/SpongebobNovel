French Narrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick] I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those.
Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.
SpongeBob: 57 times.
Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.
SpongeBob: I'm a winner?
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?!
SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! [runs into the classroom]
French Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob walks up crying]
Patrick: How'd you do, winner? [SpongeBob's crying continues] Let's see that license.
SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick.
Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick.
Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.
SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off]
Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No!
Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning.
Patrick: You're not the judge of me!
Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school]
SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy.
Patrick: I passed my test!
SpongeBob: You got a perfect score?
Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.
SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches]
Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building]
Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir.
Patrick: [smiling] How do I look?
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner.
Miss Shell: Ready?
Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says "CONGRATULATIONS" on it. Balloons and confetti fall]
SpongeBob: Huh?
Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.
Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain?
Fish: Uhh, no.
Patrick: Oh.
Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.[Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops]
Patrick: Yeah! All right!
Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling angrily]
Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... ["La Cucaracha" horn blows in his face] Whoa!
Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
SpongeBob: Two millionth?
Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you.
Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours.
Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slams his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am]
SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou— [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick?
Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today.
SpongeBob: You got your license.
Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all.
SpongeBob: You got a new boat.
Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off]
SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting very angry]
SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru?
Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
SpongeBob: I used to have a dream.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— ["La Cucaracha" horn honks]
Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving]
Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy.
SpongeBob: Oh?
Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons?
SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great.
Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you? We're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours.
Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick.
Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
SpongeBob: Mom!
Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick drives off]
Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh]
Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH']
SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman]
Patrick: What? Where? Who?
SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off]
SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights!
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop!
Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.
SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
Patrick: How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises]
SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then snatches Patrick's license out of his hand] Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [tears up Patrick's license then laughs. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.]
Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick]
SpongeBob & Patrick: It's the police!
Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug!
Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster]
Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom]
Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail]
French Narrator: One debt to society later... [door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug]
SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads "PALS 4 EVER"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
SpongeBob: Oh, then what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind]
Patrick: How's that?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Patrick: Ready, buddy?
SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo! Woo!
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are running wild with hunger and are gnawing everything in sight. A barrel crashes onto Mr. Krabs' office door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! [dodges an incoming axe] What is happening in me restaurant?!
Squidward: The customers have gone crazy! [screams as Monroe was thrown in the kitchen] SpongeBob is late for work, so there's no food!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps then grabs and shakes Squidward] But he's never been late for work in his life! Oh, this can only mean one thing. [hops on a table and rings the bell] SpongeBob has passed away!
[The customers pause for a moment and cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Or...maybe he's just seriously injured. [chuckles]
[The customers cry once more.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah, that's still bad, isn't it? [sobs along with the customers]
Squidward: [files his tentacle] I had no idea you cared that much about SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Squidward] Of course! He's been a loyal employee. His passing would be a great loss to me bank account. Oh, I—to me personally, of course. Now, come on, we have to go check on SpongeBob's possible remains.
Squidward: With pleasure! [smiles sadistically; but Mr. Krabs stares angrily at him] What? Too soon?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's pineapple. The sky is gray and the scenery looks gloomy. Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and the customers are outside SpongeBob's bedroom door.]
Mr. Krabs: Prepare yourselves for the horror. [the customers quiver, but Squidward gives a sadistic smile] Or the joy. Let's not be downers about this.
Bikini Bottomites: Oh, yeah. Okay.
Mr. Krabs: But probably, like I said, the horror!
[The customers gasp while Squidward grins maliciously. Mr. Krabs peeks in through the bedroom door. Inside, SpongeBob is still in bed with Gary sleeping on him. Gary is licking SpongeBob to get him to wake up.]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune's nightmare! That snail is eating SpongeBob's face! [rushes over to SpongeBob's bed and grabs Gary] Get away from him! [pulls Gary off of SpongeBob]
Bikini Bottomites: [overlapping chatter] Such a nice kid.
SpongeBob: [wakes up] I—I— [babbles and shakes his head before the lights turn on] Oh, good morning, everyone.
[Everyone gives SpongeBob disappointed looks and they all walk out. Mr. Krabs and Squidward stay behind to talk to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] SpongeBob, you're alive!
SpongeBob: I am? Well, thank goodness. Wait, why wouldn't I be alive?
Mr. Krabs: [sets SpongeBob down] You were late to work, so we assumed the worst.
Squidward: [rolls his eyes in annoyance] You mean, "the best."
SpongeBob: Late to work? But that's impossible! My trusty alarm clock always waked me up. [holds up his alarm clock] See? [sees it unplugged] Well, how do you like that? It's unplugged. Well, we'll just fix that and I'll never be late again.
[SpongeBob goes to plug his alarm clock back in. But the alarm clock falls over and goes bouncing around the bedroom. SpongeBob hides under the covers to prevent himself from getting hit. The alarm clock bounces back from the bed and flies under Squidward. The alarm clock bounces back from a wall and hits Squidward in the back of his head, breaking it into bits of pieces.]
SpongeBob: [catches Gary] Oh, my clock!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs stand up and see pieces of the alarm clock everywhere. The blowhorn part of the alarm clock is stuck through Squidward's neck. Squidward falls over and the blowhorn breaks.]
Mr. Krabs: Looks like you need a new clock, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, I could never replace my old clock, Mr. Krabs. We've been through a lot together. [hugs the remains of his alarm clock] It's the only alarm clock I've ever owned. I can fix it.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, good luck. But you better not be late tomorrow. [leans in closer to SpongeBob's face] Or else.
Squidward: [rubs his head] Did that stupid clock give me a bump on my head?
[Squidward shows a clock-shaped bump on his head. A woman screams in the background.]
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: [grossed out] Ugh!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob trying to fix his broken alarm clock.]
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, come on. I still love you. Let me fix you. [flicks the part] Wow!
[The clock part flies into Patrick's mouth. Patrick wakes up from sleeping and swallows the part.]
Patrick: Ooh, hey, SpongeBob, what're you doing? [hops off his rock and goes over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm just trying to fix this old alarm clock. I'm gonna need that part you swallowed, by the way.
Patrick: That's cool. Just give a couple of hours. You know, [looks through SpongeBob's magnifying glass] I could totally fix your clock for you. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know, Patrick. This clock means a lot to me and— [sees Patrick making an eager giggle] Well, okay, are you sure?
Patrick: Absolutely. Don't you worry. I promise to be super careful. [grabs some parts and tries to put them together, but they don't fit; he smashes them together in frustration] Why don't you fix?! [screams wildly as he grabs the blowhorn and smashes everything in pieces until he stops] Hmm? Uh... Sorry, SpongeBob, I couldn't fix it.
SpongeBob: Thanks for trying, Patrick, but I guess nothing lasts forever. Looks like I'm gonna need a new clock after all.
Patrick: Hmm! [laughs] In that case... [kicks some parts around and body slams them]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the clock store. He enters the store and loads of clocks are hanging on the walls.]
SpongeBob: Um, hello?
Con man: [pops out of the coo-coo clock] Hello, there! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] Welcome to Clock World, where we always have time [shows an alarm clock under his hat] for a bargain. How can I help you?
SpongeBob: [holds out a bag of the remains of his alarm clock] Do you have another alarm clock like my old one?
Con man: Hmm… [takes some of the clock's remains, licks it and examines it] Ah, the 740 Foghorn Wake-Em-Up Grand. I'm sorry to say they don't make this model anymore. But if you have a second, [shows SpongeBob a vast amount of clocks] I have many others I can show you. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Wow. So many to choose from. [his eyes are shown as clocks] Oh, I'll never be able to choose a clock with this many choices. Then I'll just take 'em all! [takes out a bunch of money and gives it to the salesman]
Con man: Ah! I'm rich! [laughs manically as he leaves the clock store] Whoo! [rushes over to the yacht store and gives the money to the yacht salesman] Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! [hops into a yacht and drives away]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting a fire hydrant alarm clock.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: My old foghorn clock was the only alarm clock that could wake me up. Sure hope one of these works. [shows a huge pile of alarm clocks he bought] Goodnight, Gare-bear. [hops into bed and goes to sleep]
[Gary goes to sleep as well. The next morning, the fire hydrant alarm clock goes off and scares Gary. The firefighter figure sprays water in SpongeBob's body, making him bigger. But SpongeBob continues to sleep.]
French Narrator: One hour later...
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? [panics and rushes over to the Krusty Krab, but trips over due to being to big from absorbing the water]
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant. Mr. Krabs is angry with SpongeBob while Squidward finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting his punching bag alarm clock.]
SpongeBob: I hope this one works. [hops into his bed and goes to sleep]
[The next morning, the punching bag alarm clock unzips itself. A bell is heard in the background and a boxing glove punches SpongeBob out of bed, injuring him in the process.]
French Narrator: Late again...
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again, this time on a wheelchair. Mr. Krabs is still angry with SpongeBob while Squidward still finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob's cast] Late!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed with his jellyfish hive alarm clock set. It goes off and jellyfish fly onto SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets stung by the jellyfish]
French Narrator: You get the idea!
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again with his body all puffy from the jellyfish.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late! [shows SpongeBob on fire with a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob with a clam eating his head and with a late paper on its shell] Late! [shows SpongeBob as a pile of dust on the ground with a late flag] Still late! [shows SpongeBob with arrows sticking through his head and a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob getting late papers all over his face] Late, late, late, late, late, late, late!
Squidward: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Still late. [smiles maliciously at SpongeBob as he whimpers]
Mr. Krabs: Late again. [the papers fall off of SpongeBob] I told you before that you best not be late or else! But this time, I'll be emphasizing it with a furrowed brow. [looks closer at SpongeBob] Or else.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sitting in his chair, thinking about what Mr. Krabs said.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know how many more "or else" I can take. [looks at the alarm clock next to him] I have to figure out a way to wake up on time.
[The alarm clock rings. Gary meows excitedly and runs over to his food bowl. The feeding machine pours snail food into his bowl and Gary eats it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what a great idea!
[SpongeBob gets up from his chair, takes all of the alarm clocks and goes off to do something with them. It took him all night long until morning arises. SpongeBob, who is now tired, goes back into his house. He climbs into bed and goes to sleep. Just then, the alarm system rings loudly and shines 6:00 down at him. The punching bag alarm clock punches SpongeBob out of his bed and lands into a wagon. The fire hydrant alarm clock sprays water at the wagon and sends SpongeBob to the door. The cuckoo clock ejects a boot and gives the wagon a little push. Outside the house, a loud thud and buzzing noise is heard. A clock with a spring pushes SpongeBob out from the front door. SpongeBob then rolls himself down the street into downtown Bikini Bottom. The street line of clocks push SpongeBob gently further down the street with their pendulums. SpongeBob rolls over to a clock in the middle of an intersection. The giant hand pushes SpongeBob to the other side. SpongeBob rolls through a painting scene that looks similar to The Persistence of Memory painting. Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are anxiously waiting for SpongeBob to arrive.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I really thought that last "or else" would've worked. Maybe I should've wagged my finger.
[SpongeBob continues to roll down the street. The wagon stops and gets sucked into the sand. The sand turns out to be part of an hour glass. The door of the hour glass opens and SpongeBob rolls out while covered in sand. Sand flies off of SpongeBob's face. The wagons rolls SpongeBob right past Mr. Krabs and Squidward and into the front doors of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is really happy that SpongeBob made it to work while Squidward stood there in complete disbelief.]
Mr. Krabs: Right on time! [turns to another sponge named SpongeTom while Squidward groans in defeat] Looks like I won't be needing you after all, SpongeTom.
SpongeTom: [drops his spatula] Oh! [stomps away]
[SpongeBob rolls into the restaurant and crashes into the register boat. SpongeBob flies into the kitchen and kicks a plank, knocking over a barrel.]
SpongeBob: [half awake] Good morning...
[The barrel hits SpongeBob's head and puts his working hat on. SpongeBob continues to sleep as some wood burns on the grill, giving away some smoke. The smoke goes up the chimney, activating the log-shaped cuckoo clock. The clock's archer figure shots an arrow at Gary.]
Gary: Meow! [groans as he pulls the roll for SpongeBob's contraption]
[It turns out that SpongeBob spent the entire night at the Krusty Krab, building a contraption out of the alarm clocks he bought. The contraption is made to create Krabby Patties for the customers. As ingredients are being hung over a rope, one clock uses its pendulum to cut the patties in pieces. One cuckoo clock blasts fire at the patties. A lighthouse clock rolls out the buns. One clock spirts mustard and ketchup on the buns. All of the ingredients fall into the funnel and form into Krabby Patties. One patty falls on a catapult. It flings the patty toward a sleeping SpongeBob. SpongeBob's snoring blows a bubble for the patty to fly into. The bubble with the patty inside floats over the window. It pops and the patty falls on the plate, ringing the bell.]
Squidward: [takes the patty and gives it to the customer] Sadly, it looks like your order's on time today. [gives the customer the patty and the bell rings again for the next order] D'oh!
[The customer sticks a dollar in Mr. Krabs' pants.]
Mr. Krabs: [gleefully giggles and goes into the kitchen with his pants full of money] Glad you finally woke up on time, boy-o! [laughs as he leaves the kitchen]
[SpongeBob continues to sleep while the contraption continues making patties.]
SpongeBob: [sleepily] Just five more minutes, Gary. [leans over until Gary pushes him up]
[Squidward gives another customer a patty. Just then, Bubble Bass cuts in front of the line.]
Squidward: Sir, there's a line.
Bubble Bass: I'm filing a complaint. [holds out his half-eaten patty] I ordered this with extra pickles. And I only count fourteen.
Squidward: [places Bubble Bass' patty on the window] SpongeBob, we got a wrong order.
[SpongeBob continues to sleep. His snoring blows a bubble and floats a patty to the window. The bubble pops and the patty lands on the grill, setting it on fire. The fire builds up so much power in the chimney that is makes the wood-shaped alarm clock shoot various arrows at Gary. Gary yelps in pain and runs off while pulling the contraption's rope. SpongeBob's clock contraption goes haywire and it clogs up the funnel, making it explode and leaving the kitchen a total mess.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in after hearing the explosion] What in Poseidon's beard?!
SpongeBob: [gasps as he finally wakes up] Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's not a good morning. First, you're late for days, and now you destroyed me kitchen!
[SpongeBob looks around and sees the mess the kitchen is in. SpongeBob giggles nervously at his angry boss.]
Mr. Krabs: [looms his angry eyes down at SpongeBob] Oh, looks like it's—
SpongeBob: [sweating nervously] Time for "or else?"
Mr. Krabs: You better be at work on time or else [calmly] I'll have to open up and close the restaurant an hour later.
SpongeBob: [confused] Uh, what? [gets upset] No! [falls to his knees as Mr. Krabs smiles maliciously at SpongeBob]
[Suddenly, Patrick comes into the kitchen.]
Patrick: I did it! [shows SpongeBob the alarm clock and it's fixed]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Yes! Oh, Patrick, you fixed it!
Patrick: Uh, kind of.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed the next morning. The foghorn alarm clock rings with Patrick making sound effects in the blowhorn. SpongeBob and Patrick share a good laugh and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]
