SpongeBob: [whistles musically. The patties on the grill begin whistling along with him]
Squidward: [sticks head through the window into the kitchen area] SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?
SpongeBob: Just a little grill-side harmony. Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like... eating and listening.
Squidward: You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face.
SpongeBob: Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock. [laughs] He had a lump on his head—
Squidward: I don't care! If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this. [inhales, plays clarinet off-key, customers jeering negative comments as they run out of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs takes the clarinet] Hey, give it back. I was just reaching my coda.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money.
Squidward: Fish flute?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know. That's what they used to call it back in the—
Squidward: None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!
SpongeBob: Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He—
Squidward: [runs out of the Krusty Krab with his clarinet] None of you know a great musician when you hear him! [he is shown via a telescope view] Not a single one of you! Not even...even— oh, there's nobody there.
Plankton: He's still doing it, Karen. He's— Karen?
Karen: Who's doing what, now?
Plankton: The skinny one. [back to the telescope view; Squidward does exactly as Plankton describes] He's been ranting and raving in front of the Krusty Krab for the past half-hour, waving his arms and jumping around like an animal. Oh, he stopped now. He's just broken down on the ground, crying. Karen. [Karen is watching TV] Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!
Karen: What, the door on your way out?
Plankton: No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too.
Karen: [sighs] I warn you against it.
Plankton: Too late! [laughs evilly, whistles casually, clears throat]
Squidward: Who said that?
Plankton: Down here! I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have.
Squidward: Oh, really?
Plankton: Yes.
Squidward: Well, let me tell you something, mister. I know exactly who you are and why you're here.
Plankton: You do?
Squidward: You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is.
Plankton: Well, that's not exactly why I—
Squidward: Shameless. [later; he is painting a picture and sees Plankton doing the same] You again?
Plankton: I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day.
Squidward: [sighs] Why, yes, it is, isn't it?
Plankton: Yes, it— not buying that one either, huh?
Squidward: Nope. [Plankton knocks on door]
Plankton: Hey, buddy! [door slams] Squidward! [door slams] Free cleaning service? [door slams] Census taker. [door slams] Good day, kind sir. Would you like to buy some Gil Scout cookies? [door slams] Ow! [tape rips]
Karen: Plankton, what are you doing?
Plankton: There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish. [grunts] Ow! I knew I should've used pipe cleaners. Hello, I'm your long-lost relative. Can I have the secret formula? [Squidward kicks Plankton, door slams]
Plankton: Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member.
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton. Nice dress. [Plankton makes an aside glance]
Plankton: Out of my way, SpongeBrain.
SpongeBob: I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round. [Plankton cries] Don't cry, Plankton. Doorslam is easy to play. Hard to master.
Plankton: None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever.
SpongeBob: Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music.
Plankton: Music?
SpongeBob: Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own.
Plankton: Oh, is that right?
Squidward: [sings to himself, grumbles] Not again.
Plankton: Wait, don't irrigate me. I've come to hear your music. It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one.
Squidward: Are you sure you got the right squid?
Plankton: I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this: play for me. Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic. [eyelashes squish]
Squidward: Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance. I will play for you, my tiny cyclops. I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne... or whatever chair he's sitting on.
Plankton: Uh-oh. I mean, goodie.
Squidward: [inhales, plays his clarinet off-key, Plankton strains and growls]
Plankton: Sweet mother of Aphrodite! Please make it end!
Squidward: Huh, huh? How are you enjoying the music so far?
Plankton: It's delightful! [Squidward plays his clarinet off-key again, earplugs pop in Plankton's ears] Bravo! [whoops, whistles, claps] Encore, encore! Yes, yes, bravo, bravo! Whoo-hoo!
Squidward: [sighs] My very own fan. [clarinet plays off-key]
Gus: Did you hear that?
Nazz-Mimi: How could I not? [beachgoers yell]
Plankton: Bravo!
Lifeguard: No, no! Make it stop! [splashes into goo, the crowd jeers and pelts Squidward and Plankton with fruit]
Plankton: Encore, encore, encore!
Squidward: I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance.
Plankton: Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to...
Squidward: Want to... sing?
Plankton: That's the word I was looking for!
Squidward: A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four. [jazzy music begins]
Plankton: ♪Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell. Shiny head is bulging he plays really well. On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet. This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ [Squidward plays riffs] ♪To hear his music playing is like, uh, music to my ears. His delightful melodies reduce grown men to tears. If you haven't heard this mollusk play you ain't hear nothing yet. This funny-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ [Squidward plays riffs, fireworks explode] ♪No one does it better. He's the best there is. When you ask him how he does it he says...♪
Squidward: It's all in the wrist. [plays off-key tune]
Plankton: Hooray!
Squidward: Thank you, thank you.
Plankton: Say, uh, musical genius?
Squidward: Yes?
Plankton: When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?
Squidward: It is an unfortunate truth.
Plankton: And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?
Squidward: That's an understatement.
Plankton: Well, I... I was just wondering, oh, incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?
Squidward: Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register. [plays clarinet]
Plankton: But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something.
Squidward: Nope. Haven't seen a thing. [continues playing]
Plankton: You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!
Squidward: Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician.
Plankton: What?
Squidward: It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed. [inhales, plays clarinet off-key, windows shatter]
Mrs. Puff: We have— [glass shattering]
Sandy: Mayday! Mayday!
Squidward: In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician.
Plankton: But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula. [growls, ear plugs pop] Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No! [earplugs sproing, Squidward begins to inhale, Plankton goes after the earplugs] Come back, I need you! [clarinet plays off-key; Plankton screams and takes the clarinet] Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!
Squidward: Hey! [panting] Come back!
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing "doorslam" and I was wondering if I could—
Squidward: Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!
SpongeBob: Whoo! I wanna play!
Plankton: [pants] Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is. [laughs, then slides down a staircase with the clarinet and keeps running, SpongeBob and Squidward fall down and start to grunt and groan]
SpongeBob: Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!
Plankton: You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!
Police fish #1: We've got you surrounded.
Plankton: You do? Oh.
Police fish #1: We've received hundreds of reports of an excruciating musical disturbance and you're the only one holding an instrument.
Plankton: Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life.
SpongeBob: He's right, officer. Plankton doesn't even play clar— [mumbles as Mr. Krabs covers his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: There, there, laddie. Just let the legal system run its course.
Police officer #1: Watch your head. [puts Plankton in police car]
Plankton: No, wait! Please! Karen, help!
Police officer #1: Oh, you won't be needing this where you're going. [police siren wails, then the police car runs over the clarinet destroying it]
SpongeBob: Boy, that was a close one, huh, Squidward? He almost got your clarinet. [clarinet snaps]
Squidward: Once again, I hate people.
Fred: You know that child we were planning on having?
Fred and his wife: Let's forget it.
[SpongeBob skids the aquarium to the front doors of the Chum Bucket where he meets up with Karen.]
Karen: SpongeBob, I could hear you caterwauling a mile away.
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, [hops off the aquarium] and thanks for watching my sea chimps while I'm at work. [inhales and blows out his work hat from his head]
Karen: They're already in an aquarium. Why don't you just leave 'em at home?
SpongeBob: [puts earphones over the aquarium and leans in closer so Karen could hear] I think Gary might be trying to eat them. I found saliva on the glass.
Karen: So what do I need to do for them?
SpongeBob: Nothing! They'll take care of themselves. Oh! [feels the wind] Hm! [takes out an umbrella] Well, I got to go. Here's my breeze. [opens his umbrella and flies away with the wind] Whoa-ow-ow-ow!
[Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has once again prevented Plankton from stealing the Krabby Patty formula and is carrying him out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: When will you ever learn that a tiny pipsqueak like you will never, ever take over anything? [stretches and squishes Plankton like putty] What do you call this gizmo you made anyway? [points to a very odd-looking device that is completely unfinished]
[Plankton's device goes haywire and puffs smoke in Plankton's face.]
Plankton: [coughs] The Takeover-er-er.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] That's just stupid. [stretches and flings Plankton back to the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: [flying by Plankton] Morning.
Plankton: Morning…
Mr. Krabs: And don't forget your rube goldfish device! [picks out the machine and hurls it away] There we go.
[Plankton lands at the front doors of the restaurant as usual. But as he got back up, the machine runs on him. Plankton crawls out from under the doors. Plankton straightens his out his back before entering the main room.]
Plankton: Honey, I'm home. [sees SpongeBob's aquarium near the doors] What's this stupid thing?
Karen: Those are SpongeBob's sea chimps. You don't need to bother with them. I'm going back to my shows now. [turns on the screen and watches her soap opera through the mirror; she sees two women fighting and slapping each other] Oh, my!
Plankton: Hmm. Huh? Sea chimps, huh? [gets a closer look through the glass and sees sea chimps continuing their happy-go-lucky lives] Wait a minute. Maybe I've been going about this world conquest thing all wrong. Maybe I should start small and work my way up! [cackles evilly]
[The scene changes to Plankton climbing up the aquarium wearing a shrinking belt.]
Plankton: This shrink belt will allow me to walk among those little monkeys. [turns the dial and shrinks smaller] Alley-oop!
[Plankton jumps and dives down the aquarium. He dives through the clouds and cackles evilly once more before landing in a pile of bananas. One sea chimp, mistaking him for a banana, grabs Plankton, peels his skin and prepares to eat him.]
Plankton: Too small, too small! [turns dial, makes himself bigger, and pulls himself out of the sea chimp's mouth] Huh?
[All of the sea chimps look at Plankton with bizarre looks. They had never seen another creature that is not of their kind in their aquarium before. Plankton then examines the sea chimps and notices that he's taller than them.]
Plankton: [giggles] Hey, why are you idiots so short? [picks up a sea chimp and forms it into a ball; he bounces it and throws it away] You afraid of me? You gonna cry?
[Plankton flicks a baby sea chimp's banana lollipop to the ground and makes it cry. All of the sea chimps run around in fright, screeching and chattering. Plankton grabs three sea chimps and ties them up together.]
Plankton: Listen here, you pint-sized twerps. I'm taking over your monkey town, see? [the sea chimps chatter nervously] Do you little cretins have a king or a queen or something?
[The sea chimps push one of their kind to show Plankton their ruler. It is a purple sea chimp with a gold crown.]
Sea chimp king: Um, I am the king.
Plankton: Yeah? Well, now I'm the king! [takes the crown from the sea chimp king and puts it on his head]
Sea chimp king: Wow! [shakes Plankton's hand] Thank you, sir! I mean, sire. [hops away] I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king-ing-ing!
Plankton: Why was that so easy? It's so easy because I'm so big and smart! [buffs up his muscles] That's why! [slips on a banana peel and falls backwards] Well, what are you all waiting for? Follow your leader! Fall! [the sea chimps obey their "king" and fall on the ground]
[The scene changes to Plankton taking over the aquarium's castle. He decorated the throne room with portraits and statues of himself. Some of the portraits have Mr. Krabs and Karen on them. Plankton is sitting on his new throne and has made the sea chimps his loyal servants. Some of them gave Plankton their gold and jewelry.]
Plankton: That's right, bring me all your valuables. [an elderly sea chimp holding a big bowl of bananas reveals dentures in his mouth] What are those? Dentures? Hand them over. [the old sea chimp gives Plankton his dentures and puts them in his mouth] Now that's more like it. I want to be the only one in town with stuff! [slips on another banana peel and falls backwards, losing his dentures and crown; the sea chimps fall down as well; Plankton picks up the crown and puts it back on] I'm tired of walking. Carry me!
[The scene changes to the sea chimps carrying Plankton on his throne. Plankton is eating grapes. He takes a grape and throws it in one of the sea chimps' face.]
Sea chimp child: Father! [goes back to licking her lollipop]
Plankton: [laughs] Right in the head! You guys are idiots. I'm the smart one. I've got the best ideas. Hey, you! Here's a grape-flavored idea! [picks a grape and throws it] Hi-yah! [throws three grapes at three sea chimps] Okay, that's enough. I'm bored.
[The sea chimps set Plankton down. Plankton rides a motor bike out from the castle window and drives down the village.]
Plankton: Yeah! [points to various sea chimps as he gloats and drives] I rule you, I rule you, I rule you. I rule you, you, you, and you. [crashes into a fire hydrant and is sent flying onto the back of an old sea chimp lady] Ow! [the sea chimps look at him in confusion] Ta-da! Piggyback for the king! Let's see how fast this old lady can go. [pulls on the old sea chimp lady's hair and kicks her] Hi-yah!
[The old sea chimp lady runs and gallops around like a horse.]
Plankton: Yee-haw! Today, sea chimps, tomorrow, the world! [as Plankton rides the old sea chimp lady down the path, one sea chimp pops out from a bush and shoots a dart] I rule you, I rule you, [gets hit in the head by the dart] and I...rule...you...
[Plankton falls backwards and groans on impact as the screen turns black. Plankton wakes up from his coma and finds himself tied in between two sacrificial poles.]
Plankton: Hey, what is this? Where am I? Okay, ha-ha. Very humorous. Having a bit of fun with the king, [chuckles] I get it. I think my armpits are dry now. You can cut me down. [the sea chimps continue to stare angrily at Plankton] I demand you obey your king! Let's go! Come on, you little bozos! Get me down! [the sea chimps no longer listens to him] Guys? My people? Loyal subjects? [gulps nervously] Buddies?
Sea chimp king: Oh! Hello! Remember me? You took my crown and became the new king? I just wanted to say thanks again. Oh, and, uh, have a nice sacrifice! [leaves]
Plankton: Sacrifice?
Sea chimps: [chanting "tongue"]
Plankton: Tongue? That's a weird request. But as king I'll be benevolent. [sticks out his tongue; suddenly, drops of water come raining down; one drop hits Plankton's eye] Gah! What in Neptune's navel?!
[Just then, as the sea chimps continue chanting, a giant pink tongue descends downward from the clouds and begins attacking Plankton.]
Plankton: [dodges the tongue's attacks] Hey! Whoa! [gets licked by the tongue] Yuck! Time to un-shrink! [tries to reach the dial on his belt, but couldn't due his hands being tied up] Can't...reach...I take it back. I don't want to be king!
Sea chimp king: Nuh-uh-uh! No takee-backsees.
[The tongue closes in on Plankton. The sea chimp king runs off to prevent himself from being licked. Just as the tongue was about to attack again, Plankton bites the tongue and sends it packing.]
Sea chimps: Aww!
Plankton: What do you mean, "aww?" Don't aww!
[The scene cuts back to the Chum Bucket. It turns out that the tongue belongs to Patrick. It also turns out that Patrick was the one trying to eat SpongeBob's sea chimps, not Gary.]
Patrick: Ow! [pulls his tongue back out of the aquarium] That hurt! [his tongue was a severe bite mark; he giggles] Now that snack's got a bite. [picks up the aquarium and drinks the water]
[Due to Patrick moving the aquarium, the sea chimps fall down Patrick's throat. Three sea chimps bind together like barrel monkey toys to prevent themselves from falling further. Plankton is left dangling above Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Oh, don't worry, sire! I will cut you loose from the sacrifice. [gnaws on the rope that's holding Plankton's right hand]
Plankton: Hey, stop! Nice old chimp king. Don't do that!
[The sea chimp king cuts through the rope and Plankton swings to the other sacrificial pole. Plankton sees most of the sea chimps descending down Patrick's throat. Patrick continues drinking the aquarium's water. The sea chimp king saws the other rope that's holding Plankton's left hand.]
Plankton: Huh? How did you get over there? [the sea chimp king cuts the rope and Plankton falls] Ahh!
Sea chimp king: [falls alongside Plankton] Hey, you're welcome!
Plankton: Hey, dumbbell! [takes off his shrink belt] Take this end of the belt and wrap it around all the other falling numbskulls and bring it back to me! [stretches the shrink belt] It stretches. Go! [they both wraps the shrink belt around the other sea chimps] You morons should cushion my fall nicely.
[Plankton and the sea chimps all fall down Patrick's throat. Just then, SpongeBob comes back from the Krusty Krab and enters the Chum Bucket. He sees Patrick drinking the aquarium water.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh, oh, oh! Patrick! It was you trying to eat my sea chimps the whole time.
[Patrick puts the aquarium down and exit the Chum Bucket in a huff. SpongeBob follows him outside.]
Patrick: I can't believe you'd accuse me of-of-of such a delicious thing! [belches and his stomach rumbles]
[SpongeBob hears his sea chimps chattering in Patrick's stomach.]
SpongeBob: I hear 'em in there. [forms an ear and listens carefully]
Sea chimp king: [inside Patrick's stomach] Hey, King, what's this dialy-doodle-mojig on your belt do?
Plankton: [inside Patrick's stomach] No, don't touch that!
[The sea chimp king turns the dial on Plankton's shrink belt and Patrick's body begins growing and expanding.]
Patrick: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! [the growing stops and it gives Patrick a bad taste of indigestion] I take it back. They weren't that delicious.
[The sea chimp king crawls out from Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Whoa! Hey, guys, come on out! There's more room out here.
[All of the sea chimp crawl out of Patrick's body. Patrick flips himself over and sticks his tongue out. Plankton appears to be partially digested and bruised from being inside Patrick's stomach.]
Plankton: [his right antennae is damaged] Partially digested antennae.
SpongeBob: Welcome, sea chimps. I'm SpongeBob, your owner.
Sea chimp king: Forget it, man. We're through with owners, and kings, and aquariums. Whoa! Now that looks like a swell place to live.
[All the sea chimps run into the Chum Bucket. Karen comes out with banana peels all over her monitor.]
Karen: [screams] Plankton! Abandon bucket!
Plankton: Well, that's a write off. [takes out a remote and pushes a button]
[The button activates the Chum Bucket's hand. The hand picks up the restaurant and spins it around and around. The hand throws the restaurant out into the distance with the sea chimps still inside.]
SpongeBob: Bye, sea chimps! Have a good flight! It was so nice of you to help relocate the sea chimps, Plankton. You rule!
Plankton: Not today, SpongeBob. Not today. [takes out his crown] But...someday! [puts it on and cackles evilly before Patrick swallows him and burps out the crown]
