# SpongebobNovel
A repo to house my markovify AI that trains on individual text files, before combining knowledge and generating a SpongeBob play.

I was inspired to take this route after watching Professor Whalen demonstrate a similar module, also using transcripts from Spongebob. The output was hilarious and I decided that I also wanted some sort of comedic output. After reading through the Markovify api and checking out how a couple different people used it, I decided to see how I could train the AI on various different text documents, but still have a central hivemind. While I used similar text in each of the read-in files, a user could use the works of various different authors and produce a result that combines the styles of each. I had a lot of fun with this project as most of the time the output sentences are barely comprehensible and feel akin to what I believe having a stroke feels like.
